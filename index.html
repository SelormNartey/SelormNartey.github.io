        <p>It all kicked off most unexpectedly,
On Instagram of all places.
Where you decide to comment on a “totally not total stranger.”
Can you believe you did that? 

But there was something undeniably magnetic about you.
Before I knew it, those casual chats morphed into frequent conversations,
And honestly, I found myself looking forward to each ping like a gamer waiting for FC 25 to launch. 

Then came that pool party.
Our first meetup,
And wow, it felt surreal.
You were there, radiating joy and lighting up the whole scene,
And suddenly, everything just clicked.
We connected effortlessly as if we’d been pals forever,
Even though it was just the start of our adventure.
          
From that day on, everything flowed so naturally,
Like it was written in the stars.
We hung out more, shared stories,
And those spontaneous moments started feeling less random.
And more like the beginning of something truly special.
          
Fast forward to April 4th, 2024—
That’s when we made it official.
Looking back, I realize it was a pivotal moment,
The day everything shifted for the better.
You’ve become my confidant,
The one who knows how to make me laugh on my toughest days,
The one who just gets me, no matter what.
          
You’ve brought a sense of fulfillment I never knew I needed.
It’s not just about being happy—
It’s the comfort of knowing that with you, I’ve got someone who’s always got my back.
You’ve infused so much joy into my life,
And it’s in those little moments that it hits home—
The way you listen, the way you care,
And how you’re unapologetically, authentically you.
          
And now, here we are,
Celebrating your 20th birthday!
I’m genuinely in awe of the incredible person you are—
Strong, compassionate, and fun to be with.
I’m just so proud to know you and even prouder to love you.
          
This is just the prologue of our story,
And I’m excited for all the chapters yet to come.
More laughter, more adventures,
More late-night chats,
And more love.
          
So, happy 20th birthday, Lil Momma!
Here’s to you, and here’s to us.
I couldn’t ask for a better partner,
And I can’t wait to see where this journey takes us next
I LOVE YOU!
